## Packages
framer-motion | Smooth animations for menus and transitions to enhance the glossy/fluid feel
zod | Schema validation (already in base, but ensuring it's noted)

## Notes
- Using Google Fonts "Varela Round" and "Nunito" to approximate the rounded "Frutiger Aero" typography.
- Game loop implemented in pure Canvas API within React refs for performance.
- Theme relies heavily on CSS gradients and box-shadows to achieve the "2000s Glossy" aesthetic.
